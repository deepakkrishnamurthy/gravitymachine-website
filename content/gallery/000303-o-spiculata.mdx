Multi-scale tracking of a *O. spiculata* (Spiny brittle star) larva showing active sinking behavior of the larvae in wide spirals. The larvae also can swim upwards actively in the water column. The interaction of ciliary activity, shape and gravity make for a rich behavioral space that can be explored using tools like Gravity Machine.
