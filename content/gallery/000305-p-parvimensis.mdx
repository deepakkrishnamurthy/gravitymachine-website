*P. parvimensis* (Warty sea cucumber) larva tracked using Gravity Machine showing an upward, helical swimming trajectory, but don't be fooled, if you watch to the end of this data-snippet, around time-stamp: 126 s, you see the larva transition to a new behavioral mode wherein it ceases upwards swimming and generates a strong feeding current which allows it to also hover in the water column.
