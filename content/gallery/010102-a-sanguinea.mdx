From tracking marine invertebrates, here we go one order in length-scale down and demonstrate tracking of single-cells with Gravity Machine. The video shows *A. sanguinea:*, a dinoflagellate cell being tracked showing highly directed downwards swimming. These cells are known to cause algal blooms off the coast of Monterey, California. Multi-scale measurements using tools like Gravity Machine, open the door to connecting individual cell behaviors to ecological-scale bloom dynamics.
