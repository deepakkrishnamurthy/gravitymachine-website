*E. gracilis:*, a single-celled algae which measures only around 10-20 microns in size is among the smallest cells we have tracked so far using Gravity Machine. These cells are know for their remarkable gravitactic behaviors and indeed are model organisms for gravitational biology. Their gravitactic ability is clearly apparent in the dataset shown here with the cells swimming in a highly directed fashion downwards.
