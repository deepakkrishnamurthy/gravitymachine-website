Gravity Machine track of a *Owenia sp.* (Polychaete worm) larva shows highly directed downward swimming behaviour. While this was true for tracks measured during day-time hours, this behaviour was flipped with larvae becoming upward swimmers during night-time. Multi-scale tracking reveals significant fluctuations in the downward swimming velocity possibly due to changes in ciliary activity resulting in a bimodal velocity distribution.
