Here we have Gravity Machine track of the giant-ciliate *S. coeruleus*. This data-snippet has several interesting features, starting with the positive gravitactic behavior of the cell, characterized by a highly-directed downward swimming. The cell's swimming speed also appears quite dynamic reflecting the state of the cilia which propel this organism through the fluid. This is particularly apparent since the cell also stops rotating about its body-axis during these pauses.
