## Scale-free Vertical Tracking Microscopy

### The challenge

<blockquote>
<p> <em>"How to track a single cell at microscale resolution while allowing free vertical movement over ecological-scales?" </em>
</p>
</blockquote>

Accessing microscale behaviors over ecological scales in the lab is a challenge since constructing a vertical water column which is even a few meters in height poses practical constraints when the desired view-point is microscopic and at a single-cell level rather than at a population-scale. 

Ideally one would want an "endless" water-column with movable microscope to follow cells as they swim up and down...

### The Idea
	
To address this challenge we invented the nearest thing we could imagine to an "endless" water-column using a simple insight "A circle has no beginning (or end)": The result is a microscope stage which functions as a "hydrodynamic treadmill" for single-cells.

	<P> The idea works as follows: An upright circular chamber with an annulus of fluid serves as our 'endless' water-column. A horizontal light-microscope focussed at either the 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock locations allows vertical movements of a cell or object to be tracked by compensatory rotation of the circular chamber such that a freely swimming cell is kept within the microscope's field-of-view. Linear tracking along the two horizontal directions allows full 3D localization of the cell. The imaging system acquires images at fast-rates and enables closed-loop 3D tracking using real-time computer vision algorithms as well as focus-tracking. Currently all the hardware components, except for the circular chamber and adapters are off-the-shelf parts.  </P>

Importantly, the system is built using fully open-source components for both hardware and software. Look out for our hardware and firmware repo release coming soon.

This video shows the setup procedure for a Gravity Machine experiment and also shows what a tracking experiment actually looks like.
