## What is Reflex?

A collection of **plugins**, **themes** and pre-built **blocks** to help you build Gatsby sites faster.

## Concepts

<Grid col={[1, 1, 2]} gap="6" alignItems="flex-start">
  <Block
    src="block-link"
    heading="Components"
    text="Learn how to use components."
    url="/docs/components"
  />
  <Block
    src="block-link"
    heading="Blocks"
    text="Build blocks and use them on pages."
    url="/docs/blocks"
  />
  <Block
    src="block-link"
    heading="Navs"
    text="Build responsive navs using Markdown."
    url="/docs/navs"
  />
  <Block
    src="block-link"
    heading="Theming"
    text="Use style props to theme your site."
    url="/docs/theming"
  />
</Grid>

## Requirements

Make sure you have the Gatsby CLI installed.

```sh
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

## Using a starter

The easiest way to use Reflex is to use the `base` starter.

To create a new site using the `base` starter run the following command:

```sh
gatsby new NAME_OF_SITE reflexjs/gatsby-starter-base
```

## Manual setup

**Step 1: Install dependencies**

Install `gatsby`, `react` and `react-dom`.

```sh
npm i gatsby react react-dom
```

**Step 2: Install Reflex core**

Add `@reflexjs/gatsby-theme-core`.

```sh
npm i @reflexjs/gatsby-theme-core
```

**Step 3: Configure Gatsby**

Create a `gatsby-config.js` file and configure `@reflexjs/gatsby-theme-core`.

```js title=gatsby-config.js
require(`dotenv`).config()

module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: "Name of your site",
    description: "Description for your site.",
    siteUrl: process.env.SITE_URL || "http://localhost:8000",
  },
  plugins: [`@reflexjs/gatsby-theme-core`], // highlight-line
}
```

**Step 4: Run your site.**

You can now run your Gatsby site:

```sh
gatsby develop
```

**Step 5: View your site**

Gatsby will start your development environment at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Creating content

Content in Reflex is created and managed using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). MDX is [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
with support for exporting and importing components.

This allows you to write content along side React components. See the following example below.

```jsx
### This is a heading

<Callout>With some paragraph in a callout.</Callout>
```

The code above will output the following:

### This is a heading

<Callout>With some paragraph in a callout.</Callout>

Every piece of content in Reflex is managed in MDX files. You place your MDX files in the `content` directory.
