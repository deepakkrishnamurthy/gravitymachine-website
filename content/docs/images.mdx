## Local images

To use and reference images in your content, place your images in the `content/images` directory.

Then reference the image using its path.

```jsx
<Image src="name-of-image.png" alt="An image" />
```

The `Image` component is a wrapper around Gatsby Image. You can learn more about Gatsby image [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/).

## Remote images

Remote images can be used the same way.

```jsx
<Image src="https://example.com/image.png" alt="External image" />
```

**Note**: Due to a [bug](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/19785) with gatsby-remark-images
and mdx, we are using a workaround for images. We'll fix this once the bug is resolved.
