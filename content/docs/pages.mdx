The core theme ships with a **Page** type. You can use a **page** to create a simple
text-based page or a complex landing page with [components](/docs/components) and [blocks](/docs/blocks).

## Add a page

To add a page, create a file in the `content/pages` directory. Example: `content/pages/about.mdx`.

A basic page looks like this.

```md title=content/pages/about.mdx
---
title: Welcome to Reflex
excerpt: Description for this page. This is mostly used for the description meta tag.
---

# Add your content here.
```

On save, Gatsby will automatically create a new page for you at `/about`.

## Using components in a page

Here's how you can use [components](/docs/components) in a page:

```jsx
---
title: Page with component
---

<Div bg="#f7f7f7" borderTop="3px solid" borderColor="tomato">
  This is a component in a page.
</Div>

And you can still use **Markdown**.
```

## Using blocks in a page

```jsx
<Block src="name-of-block" />
```

## Slugs

Every page is associated with a slug (or route).

**Example**: If you create a page at `content/pages/example.mdx`, a `slug` will automatically
be created for this page and will be accessible at `/example`.

You can manually specify the slug for a page by adding it to the page markdown.

```jsx
---
title: Example
excerpt: This is an example page with a custom slug.
slug: a-custom-slug
---
```

The page above will be accessible at `/a-custom-slug.`

**Hint**: If you name your page `index.mdx`, it will use `` as the slug. Use this to create your front page.

- `content/pages/index.mdx` will have the `/` slug.
- `content/pages/about/index.mdx` will have the `/about`slug.
