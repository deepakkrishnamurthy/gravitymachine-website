Reflex includes a few presets you can use as starting point for your themes.

You can see the presets in action in the [Blocks library](/library).

## Base

```sh
npm i @reflexjs/preset-base
```

```js title=src/@reflexjs/gatsby-theme-base/theme.js
import base from "@reflexjs/preset-base"

export default {
  preset: base,
  // Overrides.
  colors: {
    primary: `purple`,
  },
}
```

## Flex

```sh
npm i @reflexjs/preset-flex
```

```js title=src/@reflexjs/gatsby-theme-base/theme.js
import flex from "@reflexjs/preset-flex"

export default {
  preset: flex,
  // Overrides.
  colors: {
    primary: `#09f`,
  },
}
```

You can also use any [Theme UI presets](https://theme-ui.com/packages/presets).
